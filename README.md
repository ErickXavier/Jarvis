# Jarvis for Mac OS X

# This software is still in beta version.

Inspired by the movie “Iron Man” starring Robert Downey Jr, I want to recreate a computer system like Jarvis.

Jarvis is a digital life assistant that assists with your daily life by acting as an alarm clock, informing you of the latest news headlines and the forecast of the weather for the next 5 days amongst other things as well as more in the future.


For the moment the application can do:

* Greetings
* Time and date
* Calendar events
* Reminders
* Weather conditions with a 5 day forecast (from Yahoo!)
* Unread email count and VIP email count (from Apple Mail app)
* News headlines (from NYTimes)
* Daily quotations (from BrainyQuote.com)

Minimum Mac OS X version is 10.5 Leopard

The original code was written by [physicistjedi](http://goo.gl/MSthr).
